# Sentimental Analysis for Stocks

This app allows users to analyse average sentiment of the stocks of their choice per day.

## How to use:

Make sure the following libraries are installed:

pandas, nltk.sentiment.vader, matplotlib, bs4, urllib

Then run the main.py file and enter the tickers for the stocks of your choice, then based on the articles on https://finviz.com/, we get a really good visualization of the general sentiment per day for each stock.

## How to read:

A score of 0 indicates the sentiment is Neutral, while a value greater then 0 indicates the sentiment is Positive and vice versa for Negative.
